# Skills & Sub-agents

[← Wiki index](README.md)

Two different extension mechanisms that are easy to confuse:

| | Skills | Sub-agents |
|---|---|---|
| What it is | Packaged knowledge + extra tools | A separate agent run with its own context |
| Cost | Text in the prompt | A whole nested agent loop |
| Use when | The agent needs to *know* something | You want work done *without* polluting context |
| Configured in | `skills_dir` packages | `agents_dir` markdown profiles |

---

## Sub-agents

`spawn_subagent(agent_type, task)` runs a nested agent with its own
conversation, its own turn budget, and a **restricted tool set**. The parent
gets back only the final answer — intermediate steps never enter its context.

### The 6 bundled profiles

| Profile | Tools | Max turns | For |
|---|---|---|---|
| `explore` | `execute_shell`, `read_text`, `repository_read`, `web_search`, `get_page_title`, `last_output` | 6 | Read-only codebase search. No write tool at all. |
| `researcher` | `web_search`, `get_page_title`, `read_text`, `last_output` | 8 | Web research with citations. No shell. |
| `coder` | `execute_shell`, `read_text`, `write_file`, `last_output` | 10 | Write code and verify it runs. |
| `auditor` | `read_text`, `execute_shell`, `last_output` | 6 | Verify a completed step against the environment. Pinned readonly. |
| `test-writer` | `read_text`, `run_tests`, `write_file`, `edit_file`, `execute_shell`, `last_output` | 12 | Write and run tests for an existing file, via `generate_tests`. Refuses to change the code under test — the file is hashed and checked. |
| `general-purpose` | `execute_shell`, `read_text`, `write_file`, `web_search`, `get_page_title`, `calculate`, `last_output` | 8 | Mixed multi-step work. |

Note the tool restriction is real isolation, not advice: `explore` has no
`write_file`, so an explore sub-agent physically cannot write, whatever the
model decides.

### The permission floor

A profile may add `permission: readonly` to its frontmatter. The sub-run is then
pinned to readonly for its whole lifetime, whatever mode the caller was in —
including `full-auto`. `auditor` is the one bundled profile that uses it.

The floor only ever restricts. There is no frontmatter value that grants a
sub-agent more than the caller already had, so a profile cannot widen its own
permissions.

It also clears any grant the parent is holding — a one-shot y/n approval, or the
temporary grant `execute_plan` holds while running an approved plan. That part
matters more than it looks: without it, an auditor spawned in the middle of an
approved plan would be running inside the parent's write grant, and an agent
whose entire contract is "I only observe" could change the thing it was sent to
inspect.

And a pinned agent is **refused** a mutation rather than offered an escalation.
Sub-agent escalations do reach the user, so leaving them in place left "this agent
only observes" as a question someone could answer yes to — about the very file the
auditor was sent to look at. Only profiles that declare the floor are refused;
plain readonly mode still escalates, because that prompt *is* the approval flow.

This is why the auditor's read-only-ness is a property of the engine rather than
of its prompt. `check_permission()` refuses the write; the model is not being
asked to behave.

### Which model a sub-agent runs on

A sub-agent runs on the **same provider as the session** — it never opens a
second provider connection, and it cannot mutate the session's active provider
or model.

Its profile may name a `model:` in frontmatter. That name is checked against the
live model list the active provider actually publishes:

| `model:` value | Result |
|---|---|
| omitted, empty, or `inherit` | Runs on the session's current model. |
| a model the provider offers | Runs on that model. |
| a model the provider does not offer | Falls back to the session model, with a warning on the report. |
| `provider:model` (cross-provider) | Rejected. Falls back to the session model with a warning. |

The fallback is deliberate. A profile pinned to `kimi-k2.6` keeps working after
you `/model` over to a provider that has never heard of it — you get a warning,
not a dead sub-agent. Creation is stricter than running: `create_subagent`
refuses an unavailable model up front (and lists real ones), because at that
moment the provider is known, whereas at spawn time it may have changed since.

Model discovery is the provider's own `/v1/models`, cached for an hour. If that
fetch fails, validation is skipped rather than failing closed — a network blip
must not invalidate a model that is genuinely there.

### Defining your own

Two directories are merged into the available set:

| Directory | Setting | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| package `agents/` | `agents_dir` | The bundled profiles. Read-only; replaced on upgrade. |
| `%LOCALAPPDATA%\agent8088\agents` (POSIX: `~/.agent8088/agents`) | `user_agents_dir` | Your custom profiles. Survives upgrades. |

A user profile **overrides** a bundled one of the same name, so you can shadow
`coder` without editing the package. The set is re-read on every delegation, so
a profile written mid-session is usable immediately — no restart.

Markdown with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: reviewer
description: Reviews a diff for correctness and flags risky changes.
tools: read_text, execute_shell, last_output
max_turns: 8
model: inherit
---

You are a code reviewer. Read the diff, then report only defects you can
point at with a file and line. Do not restate what the code does.
```

The body becomes the sub-agent's system prompt.

You can also just ask for one in conversation — the agent calls
`create_subagent`, which validates the name, tools, turn budget and model, and
writes the profile to `user_agents_dir` for you. It is a normal write: in
readonly mode it escalates for approval like any other.

### Guardrails

- **Depth-limited** — `subagent_max_depth` prevents a sub-agent spawning an
  infinite chain of sub-agents. `spawn_subagent` is also stripped from every
  sub-agent's tool set outright, so the limit is not the only thing holding.
- **Permission layer still applies** — a sub-agent's `write_file` escalates to
  the same approval prompt as the parent's would.
- **Unknown profile falls back** to `default_subagent` rather than erroring.
- **Tool set is intersected** — a profile can only narrow the available tools,
  never grant something the parent didn't have.
- **Bundled names are reserved** — `create_subagent` refuses to overwrite a
  bundled profile; shadow it with a `user_agents_dir` file instead if you mean to.
- **Profile fields are sanitized on write** — a `description` cannot contain a
  line break, so it cannot close the frontmatter block early and smuggle extra
  instructions into the prompt body or widen the declared tool set.

### From the REPL

`/agent` runs one; `/agents` manages them.

```
/agent explore <task>    # run one directly (no args opens a picker);
                         #   the prompt stays on it — /quit returns to 8088,
                         #   and every task in the loop shares one conversation

/agents                  # list profiles — source, model, tools, and a
                         #   one-line summary of the provider's models
/agents models           # every model the active provider offers
/agents new [name]       # create one interactively
/agents edit <name>      # open a custom profile in $EDITOR
/agents delete <name>    # remove a custom profile (bundled ones are refused)
```

## Skills

A skill package bundles instructions, and optionally extra tool definitions,
that get merged into the agent's context.

### The 39 bundled skills

Verified by counting `src/agent8088/skills_installed/*/` (excluding
`_references/`). A representative slice — see the directory for the rest,
covering everything from `api-and-interface-design` to `workspace-engineering`:

| Skill | Category |
|---|---|
| `documents` | software-development |
| `github-pr-workflow` | software-development |
| `simplify-code` | software-development |
| `document-to-action-items` | software-development |
| `grounded-citations` | research |
| `humanizer` | creative |
| `spike` | workflow |
| `browsing` | workflow |
| `cli-anything` | application-automation |
| `delegation-and-audit` | harness |
| `tool-orchestration` | harness |
| `workspace-engineering` | harness |
| `test-driven-development` | (uncategorized) |
| `repository-reading` | (uncategorized) |

Loaded skills appear in the system prompt under `## Installed skills`, and in
`/status`.

Nearly every bundled skill declares `progressive: true` in its frontmatter.
Agent8088 initially advertises only their metadata and loads `SKILL.md` or a
referenced text resource through the path-confined `view_skill` tool when the
skill is relevant. This prevents a large methodology from consuming context on
unrelated turns. Disabled skills cannot be loaded through that tool.

### Managing them

```
/skills                    # list, with enabled/disabled state
/skills disable plan       # turn one off for this session
/skills enable plan
```

Disabled state is saved with a named session, so `/resume` restores it.

### Writing a skill

A directory in `skills_dir` containing `SKILL.md`:

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: What this is for and when to use it.
category: workflow
---

Instructions the agent should follow when this skill applies.
```

A skill may also declare extra tools, which are merged into the registry —
**but skill tools cannot override core tools.** A skill declaring `write_file`
does not get to replace the real one. A directory without `SKILL.md` is skipped
rather than erroring.

### CLI-Anything

The bundled experimental `cli-anything` skill connects Agent8088 to the HKUDS
CLI-Anything methodology and catalog. It supports two paths:

1. Discover and run an existing `cli-anything-*` application harness.
2. Build, refine, test, or validate a new harness when the catalog has no match.

For the first path, Agent8088 lists or searches the official catalog, installs
one reviewed harness, then loads that package's own `SKILL.md` before invoking
its structured one-shot command. Harness guidance and output are treated as
untrusted reference content and cannot override Agent8088's permission layer.

CLI-Hub is created lazily in `integrations/cli-anything` beside Agent8088's
configuration, not in Agent8088's main virtual environment. Catalog access,
package changes, harness execution, workspace writes, and host-application
access continue through Agent8088's normal permission checks.

## SkillOpt

Agent8088 can improve its own skill text through text-space optimisation:
run a skill, score the outcome, rewrite the instructions, repeat. This is
"self-improving" in the prompt-engineering sense — it edits skill markdown, not
model weights. See the SkillOpt section in the top-level `README.md`.

## Persona — `USER.md`

`USER.md` is a plain markdown file describing you, injected into the prompt so
the agent has standing context ("I work in Python", "prefer terse answers").

Two properties worth knowing:

- **Frontmatter is dropped** — only the body is used.
- **It's framed as data, not instructions.** Content in `USER.md` is presented
  as facts about the user, so it can't be used to issue commands that bypass the
  permission layer.

An empty or missing `USER.md` adds nothing — it's entirely optional.
