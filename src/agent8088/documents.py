"""Text extraction from office/PDF documents, so the model can read them as text.

Called from the file-read path as a pre-step: if `extract_text` recognizes the
extension it returns extracted text (or an error string), otherwise it returns
None and the caller falls back to reading the file as plain text/bytes.

.docx/.pptx need no dependency — both are zip files of XML, and the parts we
care about (`word/document.xml`, `ppt/slides/slideN.xml`) are handled with
stdlib `zipfile` + `xml.etree.ElementTree`. .xlsx and .pdf go through
`openpyxl`/`pypdf`, which are optional dependencies imported lazily so this
module (and anything that imports it) loads fine without them.
