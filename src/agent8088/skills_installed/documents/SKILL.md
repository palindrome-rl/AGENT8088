No dedicated document tool exists. Write a Python script, run it with
`execute_shell` (`python script.py`), then verify with `read_text`.

Libraries already installed: `python-docx`, `openpyxl`, `python-pptx`,
`reportlab`. Do not install anything else.

**"Convert this file" means the existing file's actual content, not a fresh
one you write from scratch.** A conversion path exists — LibreOffice, see
below — use it. Writing a new script that generates a *different* document
with similar-sounding content is not a conversion and does not satisfy the
request, even if the script runs successfully.

**On Windows, `execute_shell` runs `cmd.exe`, not bash — for every command in
this skill, not just the LibreOffice ones.** `cmd.exe` only understands
double quotes; a leading/trailing `'single quote'` is not stripped and gets
passed to the program literally, which is why `python -c '...'` fails with a
syntax error. Use double quotes: `python -c "..."`. Prefer writing a `.py`
file with `write_file` and running `python script.py` over an inline `-c`
one-liner — one fewer layer of quoting to get wrong.

Always use an absolute output path. A bare filename gets redirected into
`artifacts/` by write-path rules — a later `read_text` on the bare name may
miss it.

## Always verify after writing

`read_text` extracts .docx/.xlsx/.pptx/.pdf to text automatically. Run it on
every file you just wrote. A script that "succeeds" can still produce a
corrupt or empty file — don't ship one unread.

```
read_text /absolute/path/to/output.docx
```

## Legacy formats (.doc / .xls / .ppt)

Never touch these with python-docx/openpyxl/python-pptx — they don't
understand the old binary format and you will produce a corrupt file.

LibreOffice handles them. It is opt-in at install time, so many machines won't
have it — see the LibreOffice section below to check it's actually present
before relying on it.

## Word (.docx) — python-docx

Create a new document:

```python
from docx import Document

doc = Document()
doc.add_heading("Report", level=0)
doc.add_heading("Summary", level=1)
doc.add_paragraph("This is a plain paragraph.")

p = doc.add_paragraph("A paragraph with a ")
p.add_run("bold word").bold = True

table = doc.add_table(rows=1, cols=2)
table.style = "Table Grid"
hdr = table.rows[0].cells
hdr[0].text = "Name"
hdr[1].text = "Value"
row = table.add_row().cells
row[0].text = "Widgets"
row[1].text = "42"

doc.save("/absolute/path/to/report.docx")
```

Editing an existing document is open → modify → save, never regenerate from
scratch — regenerating throws away formatting the user cares about.

```python
from docx import Document

doc = Document("/absolute/path/to/report.docx")
doc.add_paragraph("Appended paragraph.")
for p in doc.paragraphs:
    if p.text == "This is a plain paragraph.":
        p.text = "This paragraph was edited."
doc.save("/absolute/path/to/report.docx")
```

## Excel (.xlsx) — openpyxl

```python
from openpyxl import Workbook

wb = Workbook()
ws = wb.active
ws.title = "Data"
ws["A1"] = "Item"
ws["B1"] = "Price"
ws.append(["Widget", 9.99])
ws.append(["Gadget", 19.99])

ws["B4"] = "=SUM(B2:B3)"          # formula, for a human opening it in Excel
ws["B5"] = 29.98                   # computed number, for a script reading it back

ws["B2"].number_format = "#,##0.00"

ws2 = wb.create_sheet("Notes")
ws2["A1"] = "Second sheet"

wb.save("/absolute/path/to/data.xlsx")
```

**Formula trap**: openpyxl writes the formula string only — no cached
result. Reading a formula cell back with `load_workbook(path, data_only=True)`
returns `None`, not the number, until something recalculates it — either real
Excel, or LibreOffice headless (see below).

Rule: if a script or the agent itself needs the *value* immediately, compute
it in Python and write the number — that's simpler than a recalculation
round-trip. Reach for LibreOffice's recalc only when the file already has
formulas you didn't write yourself (e.g. one the user handed you) and you
need their computed values.

## PowerPoint (.pptx) — python-pptx

```python
from pptx import Presentation
from pptx.util import Inches

prs = Presentation()

title_layout = prs.slide_layouts[0]
slide = prs.slides.add_slide(title_layout)
slide.shapes.title.text = "Quarterly Update"
slide.placeholders[1].text = "Prepared by the team"

bullet_layout = prs.slide_layouts[1]
slide2 = prs.slides.add_slide(bullet_layout)
slide2.shapes.title.text = "Highlights"
body = slide2.placeholders[1].text_frame
body.text = "First point"
p = body.add_paragraph()
p.text = "Second point"
p.level = 1

slide2.notes_slide.notes_text_frame.text = "Remember to mention the budget."

prs.save("/absolute/path/to/deck.pptx")
```

Editing follows the same open → modify → save pattern:
`Presentation("/absolute/path/to/deck.pptx")`, change shapes/text, then
`.save()` back to the same path.

## LibreOffice (soffice) — conversion, legacy formats, formula recalc

LibreOffice is opt-in in the installers — it is optional and slow — so plenty
of machines will not have it. If a task needs it and it is missing, and no
pure-Python route (python-docx/openpyxl/python-pptx) can do the job, tell the
user to run `agent8088 --libreoffice-setup` and stop; do not try to install it
yourself. The `convert_document` tool checks
for soffice itself and tells you plainly if it's missing — you do not need to
pre-check before calling it.

**Converting .docx/.pptx/.xlsx to PDF, or legacy .doc/.ppt/.xls to a modern
format — use the `convert_document` tool, NOT `execute_shell` with soffice.**
This is the one thing the tool exists for. It finds soffice, runs the
conversion, verifies the output file landed on disk, and reports the result.
Calling `execute_shell` with a raw soffice command instead of `convert_document`
is the wrong choice even when the command is correct — the tool handles
quoting, path resolution, and output verification you would have to do by hand.

```
convert_document: {"filename": "C:/in/report.docx", "format": "pdf"}
```

The output lands next to the source with the same basename and new extension
(`report.docx` → `report.pdf`). The tool checks the output exists on disk
rather than trusting soffice's stdout — soffice can print a success line and
still produce nothing (locked output, unsupported filter).

**Limitation: PDF → docx/pptx/xlsx is NOT supported.** LibreOffice opens PDF
as a Draw document, and Draw has no export filter for Writer/Impress/Calc
formats. The tool rejects this combination upfront. To extract text from a
PDF into an editable document, use a PDF text-extraction library
(e.g. `pdfplumber`) via `execute_shell` instead — that is a different task
than format conversion.

**Never run a bare recursive listing** (`dir /s /b` on a project directory)
to find a file — it returns thousands of lines and buries the answer. Check
the exact path you were given instead. If the user gave a relative path,
resolve it against the workspace root (the project directory, or `artifacts/`
for a bare filename).

**Recalculating formulas** in a file you didn't write yourself (e.g. one the
user handed you with existing formulas): this is the one LibreOffice case
`convert_document` does NOT cover, because it needs an isolated profile
directory to avoid collisions. Run it via `execute_shell`:

```
execute_shell: "C:\Program Files\LibreOffice\program\soffice.exe" --headless "-env:UserInstallation=file:///C:/temp/lo-profile-1" --convert-to xlsx --outdir "C:\out" "C:\in\data.xlsx"
```

Each call needs a **distinct** profile path (a fresh temp dir per call is
enough). Two `soffice` calls sharing one profile directory can collide and
fail unpredictably — this project doesn't run `soffice` inside a
network-restricted sandbox, so a fresh temp dir is enough; nothing heavier is
needed here.

**Cold start is slow** (3-5s) — well inside the tool's 60s timeout, but don't
assume the same speed as a Python library call.

## PDF — reportlab

Shortest section — PDF requests are rare. Use `SimpleDocTemplate` with a
list of flowables; reportlab lays out pagination for you.

```python
from reportlab.lib.pagesizes import letter
from reportlab.lib import colors
from reportlab.platypus import SimpleDocTemplate, Paragraph, Table, Spacer
from reportlab.lib.styles import getSampleStyleSheet

styles = getSampleStyleSheet()
doc = SimpleDocTemplate("/absolute/path/to/output.pdf", pagesize=letter)

story = [
    Paragraph("Report Title", styles["Title"]),
    Spacer(1, 12),
    Paragraph("This is body text.", styles["Normal"]),
    Spacer(1, 12),
    Table(
        [["Name", "Value"], ["Widgets", "42"]],
        style=[("GRID", (0, 0), (-1, -1), 0.5, colors.black)],
    ),
]

doc.build(story)
```

A PDF is not editable in place like docx/xlsx/pptx — there is no "open and
modify" for reportlab output. To change a generated PDF, regenerate it from
its source data.
