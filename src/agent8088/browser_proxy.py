"""Loopback-only HTTP/CONNECT forward proxy that runs a caller-supplied
host/IP check on every request before forwarding it.

browser-use (the interactive-browsing library _exec_browser delegates to)
has no per-request interception hook equivalent to Playwright's page.route(),
which is what the old single-shot browse_page used to run _egress_check and
_ssrf_check against every request the page made, not just the first
navigation. This proxy restores that guarantee at the network layer instead:
point browser-use's ProxySettings at it and every request - initial nav,
redirects, clicked links, form posts - passes through the same check.

Both existing checks are purely hostname/resolved-IP based (no path or query
dependency), so a CONNECT-level proxy has exactly the granularity needed.

        Handing a *hostname* to socket.create_connection would resolve it a
        second time, independently of the resolution the SSRF check just
        validated - a DNS-rebinding window in which an attacker-controlled
        record answers "public" for the check and "127.0.0.1" for the
        connection. So resolve once here and check that exact address before
        connecting to it.

        The resolved-and-approved address is memoized per proxy instance (one
        proxy = one browse_page call): a page pulls dozens of assets from the
        same handful of hosts, and re-resolving each time cost a median ~20ms
        - over 160ms on a cold lookup - on every request. The cache *pins*
        the very address check_address approved, so a short-TTL record that
        answers differently mid-browse cannot swap the destination; the same
        check_address runs again on the cached IP anyway. A cached address
        that stops connecting is evicted and resolved fresh.
